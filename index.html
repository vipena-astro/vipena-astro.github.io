        <h2>About me</h2>
        <p>
            Since 2023, I am a master's student in Astrophysics at <a context=citet href=https://uc.cl/en>UC Chile</a>. In 2022, I was conferred the degree of Licentiate in Astronomy at UC Chile.
        </p>
        
        <h2>Research interests</h2>
        <p>
            I am fascinated about how we can establish <b>theoretical</b> links between the <b>microphysics</b> of compact objects (<b>black holes</b>, <b>neutron stars</b>, etc.) and their possible <b>observational signatures</b>, especially in the era of <b>multi-messenger astronomy</b>. I am amazed by how theories that are simple and elegant in essence can be orchestrated together to look at complex phenomena with exquisite detail, so I enjoy studying models that incorporate <b>general relativity, quantum mechanics, hydrodynamics, plasma physics, etc.</b> In the context of compact objects, this means looking at quantum phenomena near event horizons, linking gravitational radiation coming from crustal quakes in neutron stars to variations in their magnetospheric electromagnetic radiation (e.g., quasi-periodic oscillations), wondering about possible observational signatures of neutron star theories on nuclear-pasta crusts or on chromoplasma cores via both electromagnetic and gravitational radiation events, or even carefully venturing past the event horizon in a black hole.

            During my <b>undergraduate thesis</b>, I studied how the orbital evolution of a binary system in a crowded neighbourhood is driven by the objects making up the crowd. In particular, we applied this to <b>binaries in globular galactic centres</b> (nuclear star clusters, NSCs), and compared the overall effect of the NSC with the aggregated effect of individual stars flying by close to the binary. We found synergies between both approaches that had not been considered before, which led to the publication of <citet>Winter-Granic, et al. 2024, ApJ, 973, 53, doi:</citet> <a context=citet href=http://doi.org/10.3847/1538-4357/ad61e1>10.3847/1538-4357/ad61e1</a>.

            During my <b>master's thesis</b>, I have been studying the <b>dynamics of black hole (BH) populations in the central parsec of accretion discs in active galactic nuclei (AGNi)</b> with a central supermassive BH (SMBH), focusing on how the details of the stellar-mass BH (sBH) <b>initial mass function</b> (IMF) and of the <b>accretion disc physics</b> affect the radial <b>migration of sBHs</b> across the disc. The formalism initially developed to study protoplanet migration in protoplanetary discs can be applied to these dynamical systems, finding are annular regions in the disc where inward and outward migration converge. We call these regions <b>"migration traps"</b>, and they provide an enhanced environment for BH <b>hierarchical mergers</b>. sBHs grow in mass, eventually stepping into the intermediate-mass BH (IMBH) regime and becoming dynamically insensitive to the trap, hence infalling into the SMBH and emmitting a characteristic <b>gravitational wave</b> (GW) signal. The statistics of different parameters describing these GWs is expected to depend on the initial statistics of the system, viz. the sBH IMF, and on the thermodynamics of the accretion disc material, which regulates how the disc drives BH migration. We expect these signals to be detectable by the future Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (<b>LISA</b>).
